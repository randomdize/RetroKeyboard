======
This version only supports Mac OS X 10.6 or above. It uses CoreFoundation instead of Carbon framework in the previous version, so it's 64-bit ready.

What's New:

* A new built-in keyboard profile "Speak Letter (QWERTY)" included.
* 64-bit ready.
* Compatible (and only) with Snow Leopard.
* zh_TW localization added.
